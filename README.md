# List Code Smart Contract

This is a collection of smart contracts that I have written and practiced while learning and working with blockchain technology. The list includes smart contracts developed using Solidity, deployed on platforms like Ethereum, BSC, Polygon, and applied in areas such as DeFi, NFT, and GameFi.

# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Lock.js
```
